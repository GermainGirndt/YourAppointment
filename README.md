#### Brief Preface
Last update: 2020/05/07  

YourAppointment is my very first medium-term project developed from scratch, which is my first draft for a future project of this type using Django.  
  
YourAppoint served the purpouse of putting fundamental programming concepts in practice such as OOP, TDD, Data Validation, Relational Database Management and Data Base Integration (SQLite), Version Control Systems (GIT) and Software Architecture (still working on it hahaha).


# YourAppointment (in development)
YourAppointment is a simple and practical App for Appointment Management.
      
   
## App's Goal
YourAppointment's goal is to organize the **appointment booking with clients**, by using a fast, clean and reliable User Interface for Customers and Appointments Management.
